Introduction
    ./trace.js is designed to convey compatibility to ActionScript on Flash.
    ActionScript has trace() function which is very useful. Web browser does
    not have it though.

    Example)
        <html>
        <head>
            <script src="hello.js"></script>
        </head>
        <body>
            <script>
                // test the Hello here.
                trace( "Hello=" + Hello );
                var hello = new Hello();
                trace( hello );
                trace( "The result is " + hello.world() );
                trace( "Finished!" );
            </script>
        </body>
        </html>

    This HTML generates a simple test report of Hello class.

Restriction
    Function trace() must be called in <body></body> tags.
    If you don't like this feauture, use "trace.async.js" which process
    messages asynchronously.  Though, there are certain situations that
    "trace.js" is more useful than "trace.async.js".
